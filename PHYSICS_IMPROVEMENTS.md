# Physics Implementation Improvements

## Overview

The physics implementation has been significantly improved, particularly the `shape_cast` method and overall collision detection system. The improvements focus on robustness, accuracy, and comprehensive collision handling.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Shape Cast Implementation

#### Previous Issues:
- **Simplified implementation**: Only performed point query at end position
- **Incorrect normal calculation**: Used hardcoded (0, 1) normal
- **No swept collision detection**: Didn't check collisions along movement path
- **Poor large movement handling**: Could skip through thin objects

#### New Implementation:
- **Proper swept collision detection** along the entire movement path
- **Accurate collision normals** calculated from actual shape interactions
- **Stepped collision detection** to handle large movement deltas
- **Exclude body parameter** to prevent self-collision
- **Multiple collision detection** with `shape_cast_all` method

### 2. Robust Collision Detection Methods

#### New Methods Added:

**`shape_cast()`**
```python
def shape_cast(self, shape_type: str, size: Tuple[float, float],
               start: Tuple[float, float], end: Tuple[float, float],
               collision_mask: int = 0xFFFFFFFF, exclude_body: Optional[PhysicsBody] = None) -> Optional[Dict]
```
- Performs swept collision detection along movement path
- Returns first collision with accurate distance, point, and normal
- Handles both circle and rectangle shapes
- Excludes specified body from collision detection

**`shape_cast_all()`**
```python
def shape_cast_all(self, shape_type: str, size: Tuple[float, float],
                  start: Tuple[float, float], end: Tuple[float, float],
                  collision_mask: int = 0xFFFFFFFF, exclude_body: Optional[PhysicsBody] = None) -> List[Dict]
```
- Returns all collisions along the path, sorted by distance
- Useful for detecting multiple objects in movement path

**`test_move()`**
```python
def test_move(self, body: PhysicsBody, move_delta: Tuple[float, float]) -> Optional[Dict]
```
- Tests if a body can move without collision
- Returns collision info if movement would cause collision
- Automatically determines shape type and size from body

**`get_overlapping_bodies()`**
```python
def get_overlapping_bodies(self, body: PhysicsBody) -> List[PhysicsBody]
```
- Returns all bodies currently overlapping with given body
- Useful for detecting overlaps at current position

### 3. Improved Collision Detection Algorithm

#### Stepped Collision Detection:
- Divides large movements into smaller steps
- Step size calculated based on shape size for optimal accuracy/performance
- Prevents tunneling through thin objects
- Maintains performance with reasonable step counts

#### Accurate Normal Calculation:
- Uses Pymunk's contact point detection when available
- Falls back to center-to-center vector calculation
- Provides consistent collision normals for sliding behavior

#### Shape Type Support:
- **Circles**: Proper radius handling and collision detection
- **Rectangles**: Accurate bounding box collision detection
- **Automatic detection**: Determines shape type from physics body

### 4. Enhanced KinematicBody2D Integration

#### Improved Methods:

**`_test_move()`**
- Now uses robust shape_cast instead of simple raycast
- Excludes own physics body from collision detection
- Provides accurate collision information for sliding

**`_check_collision_along_path()`**
- Upgraded from raycast to shape_cast for better accuracy
- Automatically determines collision shape size
- Handles both circle and rectangle collision shapes

**`move_and_slide()`**
- Benefits from improved collision detection
- More accurate sliding behavior
- Better handling of complex collision scenarios

### 5. Helper Methods for Robust Detection

#### `_perform_swept_collision()`
- Core swept collision detection algorithm
- Handles step-by-step movement checking
- Optimizes step size based on shape dimensions

#### `_check_collision_at_position()`
- Detailed collision checking at specific positions
- Uses both point queries and shape-to-shape collision detection
- Excludes sensors and specified bodies

#### `_check_shape_overlap()`
- Specialized overlap detection for zero movement
- Handles static overlap scenarios
- Returns detailed collision information

#### `_shapes_colliding()`
- Robust shape-to-shape collision detection
- Uses Pymunk's native collision detection
- Falls back to bounding box check if needed

#### `_calculate_collision_normal()`
- Accurate collision normal calculation
- Uses contact points when available
- Provides fallback normal calculation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Shape Cast
```python
# Cast a rectangle from point A to point B
result = physics_world.shape_cast(
    "rectangle",
    (32.0, 32.0),  # width, height
    (100.0, 100.0),  # start position
    (200.0, 100.0),  # end position
    exclude_body=player_body  # exclude player from detection
)

if result:
    print(f"Collision at distance: {result['distance']}")
    print(f"Collision normal: {result['normal']}")
    print(f"Hit body: {result['body'].node.name}")
```

### Test Movement Before Executing
```python
# Test if movement is safe before actually moving
collision = physics_world.test_move(kinematic_body, (50.0, 0.0))

if collision:
    print("Movement would cause collision!")
else:
    # Safe to move
    kinematic_body.translate(50.0, 0.0)
```

### Find All Collisions Along Path
```python
# Get all objects that would be hit along movement path
collisions = physics_world.shape_cast_all(
    "circle",
    (20.0, 20.0),  # diameter
    start_pos,
    end_pos
)

for collision in collisions:
    print(f"Hit {collision['body'].node.name} at distance {collision['distance']}")
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations:
- **Adaptive step size**: Based on shape dimensions for optimal accuracy/performance ratio
- **Early termination**: Returns first collision found in single-collision queries
- **Efficient shape queries**: Uses Pymunk's optimized collision detection
- **Temporary shape management**: Properly adds/removes temporary shapes from physics space

### Performance Guidelines:
- Use `shape_cast()` for single collision detection (faster)
- Use `shape_cast_all()` only when multiple collisions needed
- Consider collision masks to filter unnecessary checks
- Large movements are automatically optimized with stepped detection

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_improved_physics.py
```

The test suite covers:
- Basic shape casting with no collision
- Shape casting with collision detection
- Circle vs rectangle shape casting
- Large movement delta handling
- Multiple collision detection
- Zero movement overlap checking
- KinematicBody2D integration testing

## Backward Compatibility

All existing physics functionality remains unchanged. The improvements are:
- **Additive**: New methods and parameters added
- **Enhanced**: Existing methods improved internally
- **Compatible**: All existing code continues to work
- **Optional**: New features are opt-in via parameters

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:
- **Continuous collision detection**: For very high-speed objects
- **Polygon shape support**: For complex collision shapes
- **Collision filtering**: More sophisticated filtering options
- **Performance profiling**: Detailed performance metrics and optimization
- **Multi-threading**: Parallel collision detection for complex scenes
