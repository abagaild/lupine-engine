## Usage Examples

### Basic Scene Instantiation
```python
# Create scene instance manager
instance_manager = SceneInstanceManager(scene_manager)

# Create a scene instance
player_instance = instance_manager.create_instance(
    "scenes/Player.scene", 
    "Player1"
)

# Add property overrides
player_instance.property_overrides["Player/position"] = [100, 200]
player_instance.property_overrides["Player/health"] = 150
```

### Instance Pooling
```python
# Create instance pool for frequently used scenes
instance_manager.create_instance_pool("scenes/Enemy.scene", pool_size=10)

# Get instance from pool (very fast)
enemy = instance_manager.create_instance("scenes/Enemy.scene", use_pool=True)

# Return to pool when done
instance_manager.destroy_instance(enemy, return_to_pool=True)
```

### Batch Operations
```python
# Create multiple instances efficiently
requests = [
    {"scene_path": "scenes/Enemy.scene", "instance_name": "Enemy1"},
    {"scene_path": "scenes/Enemy.scene", "instance_name": "Enemy2"},
    {"scene_path": "scenes/Pickup.scene", "instance_name": "Pickup1"}
]

instances = instance_manager.batch_create_instances(requests)
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Start monitoring
monitor = SceneInstanceMonitor(instance_manager)
monitor.start_monitoring()

# Add alert callback
def performance_alert(alert):
    print(f"Performance Alert: {alert['message']}")

monitor.add_alert_callback(performance_alert)

# Get performance summary
summary = monitor.get_performance_summary()
print(f"Memory usage: {summary['current_memory_mb']} MB")
```

### Instance Variants
```python
# Create base instance with overrides
base_player = instance_manager.create_instance("scenes/Player.scene")
base_player.property_overrides["Player/speed"] = 100

# Create variant with different properties
fast_player = base_player.create_variant("FastPlayer")
fast_player.merge_overrides({"Player/speed": 200})
```

## Performance Metrics

The system has been tested and optimized for:

- **Instance Creation**: < 1ms for pooled instances, < 10ms for new instances
